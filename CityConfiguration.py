        Initialize a networkx graph where each node is a coordinate in the city, with its properties being zone number,
        population density of zone. Add edges between every pair or coordinates with the time property equal
        to sum of the distance between the two coordinates and a penalty parameter which is randomized as a
        probability distribution of the population densities of the two nodes.
        Also initialize a mapping of zone numbers to their population densities and top-left corner coordinates
        (this will be used to randomize zone of an emergency as a distribution of the population
        density and then determine a random coordinate within the zone)
